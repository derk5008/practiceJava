Basic Points:

1. Two Classes: Note, List;

2. Every time it is start with "Head": Head is a node, but it is not the Object in list. The first object in List is head.getNext()

3. Head is the first item in list; and last item's link points to null;

4. All process, like "Insert", "Add", "Remove" are playing around with Current and next();

5. Add: loop to the last item;

6. insert/remove: loop to the item right before the wanted index. For example, insert(Obj, 5). The index will stop and point to the 4th item in list

7. In LinkedList, there two private property: Node head, int count
